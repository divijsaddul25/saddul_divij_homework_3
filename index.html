            <h3 class="lb_heading">John Wick</h3>

            <p class="lb_text">
                The titular lead character of the John Wick film series is Jonathan "John" Wick, also known as Baba Yaga (also known as "The Boogeyman") and born Jardani Jovonovich. He is a well-known hitman who, up until his retirement, was employed by the Tarasov Mafia. After the passing of his wife, John left retirement after Iosef Tarasov, Viggo's son, killed his dog Daisy and stole his automobile. The Camorra mob heir Santino D'Antonio pushed him to kill his sister, Gianna, so that he could inherit their family's legacy. He was successful in his mission by killing Iosef and eventually Viggo. After taking out scores of High Table assassins, John is betrayed by Winston, who shoots him to take back his position.
                John encounters the Elder, the head of the Table, through his old pals in Ruska Roma and Sofia, who pledge to pardon his transgressions and remove his excommunication status in exchange for him killing Winston. Winston eventually persuades John to live as the husband his wife loved rather than the Boogeyman.

Morpheus describes it as a general feeling that Neo has had his entire life: that there is something wrong with the Earth. Before the events of The Matrix, Anderson spent his time looking for the right person He believed that a rumoured terrorist going by the name of Morpheus could teach him what the Matrix was. Anderson receives an unexpected call from Morpheus on a smartphone delivered to his workplace, but is quickly apprehended by the virtual reality agents under the command of Agent Smith. Neo has an electronic bug inserted into his Matrix-simulated body after refusing to cooperate with the agents so that his actions may be monitored and anyone attempting to contact him from the free world can be found and eliminated.

                <h3 class="lb_heading">Tyler Durden</h3>
    
                <p class="lb_text">
                    In contrast to the narrator, Tyler Durden is a minimalist and neo-luddite who is intelligent, competent, personable, and intuitive. In his Arcadian utopia, men and women would live freely without the constraints of society, unbridled materialism, popular culture, or human society. He developed his skills, strength, speed, and toughness while in Fight Club, signifying the development of his mentality as it gained more control over the Narrator's thoughts. Tyler is demonstrated to be able to interact physically with the Narrator when he or she is in charge. This raises the question of whether Tyler is a separate eldritch person or an alter ego.

                    <p class="lb_text">
                        Scarface, a 1983 epic crime thriller that is a loose replica of the 1932 film of the same name, stars Antonio "Tony" Montana as the title main character.

Tony Montana was once a lowly Cuban refugee who gradually rose through the criminal underworld to become one of the most powerful drug lords in Miami. Tony Montana is undoubtedly one of the most recognisable villains in movie history.
